## Example training

This code provides some example scripts and snippets to help you understand about the functionalities.

### Training example model

For classification and segmentation, see [`train_classification.sh`](./train_classification.sh) and [`train_segmentation.sh`](./train_segmentation.sh) for each.  
Each shell sciprt contains two commands: (1) single-gpu training and (2) multi-gpu training.
A default option is using **single-gpu**, but you can edit the script if you needed.
