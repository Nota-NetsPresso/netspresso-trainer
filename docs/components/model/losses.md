# Losses

Loss modules is very important in the training of neural networks, because it actually guides and shapes the learning process by minimizing the loss. It can affect the speed of convergence during training and the overall robustness of the model. 

However, loss functions can vary depending on the tasks, especially in tasks like detection and segmentation, where specialized loss functions are required. Therefore, NetsPresso Trainer provides a predefined variety of loss modules, designed for flexible use across different tasks. Users can seamlessly apply the appropriate loss function to their desired task through simple configuration settings.


## Supporting loss modules

The currently supported methods in NetsPresso Trainer are as follows. Since techniques are adapted from pre-existing codes, hence most of the parameters remain unchanged. We notice that most of these parameter descriptions are from original implementations.

We appreciate all the original code owners and we also do our best to make other values.

### CrossEntropyLoss

Cross entropy loss. This loss follows the [CrossEntropyLoss](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss.html) in torch library.

| Field <img width=200/> | Description |
|---|---|
| `criterion` | (str) Criterion must be "cross_entropy" to use `CrossEntropyLoss`. |
| `label_smoothing` | (float) Specifies the amount of smoothing when computing the loss, where 0.0 means no smoothing. |
| `weight` | (float) Weight for this cross entropy loss. |
