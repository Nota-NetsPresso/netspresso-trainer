# Transforms

Users can easily create their own augmentation recipe simply by listing their desired data transform modules. It's possible to adjust the intensity and frequency of each transform module, and the listed transform modules are applied in sequence to produce augmented data. In NetsPresso Trainer, a visualization tool is also provided through a Gradio demo, allowing users to see how their custom augmentation recipe produces the data for the model.

## Supporting transforms

The currently supported methods in NetsPresso Trainer are as follows. Since techniques are adapted from pre-existing codes, most of the parameters remain unchanged. We note that most of these parameter descriptions are derived from original implementations.

We appreciate all the original code owners and we also do our best to make other values.

### CenterCrop

This augmentation follows the [CenterCrop](https://pytorch.org/vision/0.15/generated/torchvision.transforms.CenterCrop.html) in torchvision library.

### HSVJitter

HSVJitter is based on `augment_hsv` function of [YOLOX repository](https://github.com/MegviiBaseDetection/YOLOX/blob/ac58e0a5e68e57454b7b9ac822aced493b553c53/yolox/data/data_augment.py#L21-L31).

        v_mag: 30
  ```

### Mixing

We defined Mixing transform as the combination of CutMix and MixUp augmentation. This shuffles samples within a batch instead of processing per image. Therefore, **Mixing transform must be in the last function of augmentation racipe** if user wants to use it. Also, Mixing not assumes a batch size 1. If both MixUp and CutMix are activated, only one of two is randomly selected and used per batch processing.

Cutmix augmentation is based on [CutMix: Regularization strategy to train strong classifiers with localizable features](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2019/papers/Yun_CutMix_Regularization_Strategy_to_Train_Strong_Classifiers_With_Localizable_Features_ICCV_2019_paper.pdf) and MixUp augmentation is based on [mixup: Beyond empirical risk minimization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.09412.pdf%C2%A0). These implementation follow the [RandomCutmix and RandomMixup](https://github.com/apple/ml-cvnets/blob/77717569ab4a852614dae01f010b32b820cb33bb/data/transforms/image_torch.py) in the ml-cvnets library.

Currently, NetsPresso Trainer does not support a Gradio demo visualization for Mixing. This feature is planned to be added soon.

| Field <img width=200/> | Description |
|---|---|
| `name` | (str) Name must be "mixing" to use `Mixing` transform. |
| `mixup` | (list[float], optional) List of length 2 which contains [mixup alpha, applying probability]. If None, mixup is not applied. |

| `inplace` | (bool) Whether to operate as inplace. |

### MosaicDetection

This MosaicDetection augmentation is based on [YOLOX repository](https://github.com/Megvii-BaseDetection/YOLOX). For each sample, the following steps are taken to create an augmented sample.

- Merge the four images into one, with the merge center point randomly determined.
- Apply a random affine transformation to the merged image. And resize output image to fit the `size`.

### RandomHorizontalFlip

Horizontally flip the given image randomly with a given probability. This augmentation follows the [RandomHorizontalFlip](https://pytorch.org/vision/0.15/generated/torchvision.transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip.html#torchvision.transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip) in torchvision library.

| Field <img width=200/> | Description |

</details>

### RandomResize

RandomResize transforms the input image to a random size within a specified range. This random size range is determined by [`base_size[0]` - `stride` * `v`, `base_size[1]` + `stride` * `v`] with `stride` interval, where the value `v` is an integer within the range of [`-random_range`, `random_range`]. E.g. If `base_size = [256, 256]`, `stride = 32`, `random_range = 2`, possible output image sizes are `[[192, 192], [224, 224], [256, 256], [288, 288], [320, 320]]`.

Since applying random resize to every image arises the difficulty of a batch handling, random resize should be applied on a per-batch basis. However, due to current implementation constraints, it's challenging to apply randomness at the batch level, so a single random size is determined per dataloader worker. The size managed by each worker changes to at the start of each epoch. Therefore, to fully benefit from RandomResize, the number of workers set by `environment.num_workers` needs to be sufficiently large.

| Field <img width=200/> | Description |
|---|---|
| `name` | (str) Name must be "randomresize" to use `RandomResize` transform. |
| `base_size` | (list) The base size of the output image after random resizing. The output size is determined based on `base_size`. |
| `stride` | (int) The interval at which the size variation occurs. |
| `random_range` | (int) The range for random size variation. The final size is determined in range of [`base_size[0]` - `stride` * `v`, `base_size[1]` + `stride` * `v`] with `stride` interval, where `v` is an integer within the range of [`-random_range`, `random_range`]. |
| `interpolation` | (str) Desired interpolation type. Supporting interpolations are 'nearest', 'bilinear' and 'bicubic'. |

### RandomResizedCrop

|---|---|
| `name` | (str) Name must be "randomresizedcrop" to use `RandomResizedCrop` transform. |
| `size` | (int or list) Desired output size of the crop. If size is an int, a square crop (`size`, `size`) is made. If provided a list of length 1, it will be interpreted as (`size[0]`, `size[0]`). If a list of length 2 is provided, a crop with size (`size[0]`, `size[1]`) is made. |
| `scale` | (float or list) Specifies the lower and upper bounds for the random area of the crop, before resizing. The scale is defined with respect to the area of the original image. |
| `ratio` | (float or list) lower and upper bounds for the random aspect ratio of the crop, before resizing. |
| `interpolation` | (str) Desired interpolation type. Supporting interpolations are 'nearest', 'bilinear' and 'bicubic'. |

### RandomVerticalFlip

| Field <img width=200/> | Description |
|---|---|
| `name` | (str) Name must be "resize" to use `Resize` transform. |
| `size` | (int or list) Desired output size. If size is a sequence like (h, w), output size will be matched to this. If size is an int, smaller or larger edge of the image will be matched to this number and keep aspect ratio. Determining match to smaller or larger edge is determined by `resize_criteria`. |
| `interpolation` | (str) Desired interpolation type. Supporting interpolations are 'nearest', 'bilinear' and 'bicubic'. |
| `max_size` | (int, optional) The maximum allowed for the longer edge of the resized image: if the longer edge of the image exceeds `max_size` after being resized according to `size`, then the image is resized again so that the longer edge is equal to `max_size`. As a result, `size` might be overruled, i.e the smaller edge may be shorter than `size`. This is only supported if `size` is an int. |
| `resize_criteria` | (str, optional) This field only used when `size` is int. This determines which side (shorter or longer) to match with `size`, and only can have 'short' or 'long' or `None`. i.e, if `resize_criteria` is 'short' and height > width, then image will be rescaled to (size * height / width, size). |
