    Drop paths (Stochastic Depth) per sample (when applied in main path of residual blocks).

    Comment by Ross Wightman: This is the same as the DropConnect impl I created for EfficientNet, etc networks,
    however, the original name is misleading as 'Drop Connect' is a different form of dropout in a separate paper...
    See discussion: https://github.com/tensorflow/tpu/issues/494#issuecomment-532968956 ... I've opted for changing the
    layer and argument names to 'drop path' rather than mix DropConnect as a layer name and use 'survival rate' as the
    argument.
